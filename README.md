## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

As you can see, vehical length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because some of the P value is really low (meaning high significance linearly).
This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes relatively effectively as the R-squared value is about .71.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

All manufacturing lots in total meet the design specification of the variance of the suspension coils not exceeding 100 pounds per square inch. However, if we look at the lots individually, we can see that lots 1 and 2 meet this requirement but lot 3 doesn't.

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Some parameters we could add in that could help consumers pick out a car are miles per gallon (both highway and city), cost, safety rating, maintenance cost (i.e. replacing tires), trunk space, leg room, etc..
