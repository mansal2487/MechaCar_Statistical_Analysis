## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![alt text](https://github.com/mansal2487/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/Images/lin_reg.PNG)

As you can see, vehical length and ground clearance provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset.
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero because some of the P value is really low (meaning high significance linearly).
This linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes relatively effectively as the R-squared value is about .71.
